# restful_resource (Resource)

`restful_resource` manages a restful resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "restful_resource" "rg" {
  path = format("/subscriptions/%s/resourceGroups/%s", var.subscription_id, "example")
  query = {
    api-version = ["2020-06-01"]
  }
  create_method = "PUT"
  poll_delete = {
    status_locator = "code"
    status = {
      success = "404"
      pending = ["202", "200"]
    }
  }
  body = jsonencode({
    location = "westus"
    tags = {
      foo = "bar"
    }
  })
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `body` (String) The properties of the resource.
- `path` (String) The path of the resource, relative to the `base_url` of the provider. It differs when `create_method` is `PUT` and `POST`.

### Optional

- `create_method` (String) The method used to create the resource. Possible values are `PUT` and `POST`. This overrides the `create_method` set in the provider block (defaults to POST).
- `header` (Map of String) The header parameters that are applied to each request. This overrides the `header` set in the provider block.
- `ignore_changes` (List of String) A list of paths (in [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md)) to the attributes that should not affect the resource after its creation.
- `name_path` (String) The path to the name attribute in the response, which is only used during creation of the resource to construct the resource identifier. This is ignored when `create_method` is `PUT`. Either `name_path` or `url_path` needs to set when `create_method` is `POST`.
- `poll_create` (Attributes) The polling option for the "Create" operation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_create))
- `poll_delete` (Attributes) The polling option for the "Delete" operation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_delete))
- `poll_update` (Attributes) The polling option for the "Update" operation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_update))
- `query` (Map of List of String) The query parameters that are applied to each request. This overrides the `query` set in the provider block.
- `url_path` (String) The path to the id attribute in the response, which is only used during creation of the resource to be as the resource identifier. This is ignored when `create_method` is `PUT`. Either `name_path` or `url_path` needs to set when `create_method` is `POST`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the Resource. Same as the `path` when the `create_method` is `PUT`.
- `output` (String) The response body after reading the resource.

### Nested Schema for `poll_create`

Optional:

- `default_delay_sec` (Number) The interval between two pollings if there is no `Retry-After` in the response header, in second.
- `status` (Attributes) The expected status sentinels for each polling state. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--poll_create--status))
- `status_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the status property. The format is either `code` or `<scope>[<path>]`, where `<scope>` can be either `header` or `body`, and the `<path>` is using the [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
- `url_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the polling location. The format is as `<scope>[<path>]`, where `<scope>` can be either `header` or `body`, and the `<path>` is using the [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md). When absent, the resource's path is used for polling.

<a id="nestedatt--poll_create--status"></a>
### Nested Schema for `poll_create.status`

Optional:

- `pending` (List of String) The expected status sentinels for pending status.
- `success` (String) The expected status sentinel for suceess status.

### Nested Schema for `poll_delete`

- `status_locator` (String) Specifies how to discover the status property. The format is either `code` or `<scope>[<path>]`, where `<scope>` can be either `header` or `body`, and the `<path>` is using the [gjson syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
